# Generative AI Research Project – File Structure Overview

This folder structure is designed to organise all research data, documents, and scripts related to the project “Using Generative AI Tools – Boon or Bane?”. Each directory serves a specific purpose and reflects the various stages and types of data involved in the research.

## Folder Descriptions

- `Literature_Review/`  
  Contains background research materials, including journal articles, conference papers, books, and news articles.

- `Quantitative_Analysis/`  
  Stores all files related to quantitative methods such as surveys. Includes survey questions, raw and cleaned data, analysis scripts (e.g., Python, Excel), and analytical reports.

- `Qualitative_Analysis/`  
  Contains interview transcripts, interview protocols, consent forms, insight reports, and related visualisations.

- `Drafts_and_Reports/`  
  Holds draft proposals, conference submissions, and final research reports.

- `Additional_Materials/`  
  Stores information sheets, media files, and photographs that supplement the research documentation.

- `README_notes/`  
  Used to store drafts and planning notes for future documentation (e.g., this file, before it is formalised into README.md).

## Naming Convention

All folders and files follow clear, descriptive naming using lowercase letters and underscores. No spaces are used to ensure compatibility across systems.

## Notes

Sensitive data (e.g., consent forms, interview transcripts) will be subject to access control in future repository configurations.
